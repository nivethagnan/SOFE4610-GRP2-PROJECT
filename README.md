## Project Description
This project is aimed to make the process of attendance easier and more efficient. The goal is to make an IoT-based RFID Attendance System using the Arduino Board, Adafruit.io platform using the MQTT broker, RFID Module and RFID Cards. Arduino and RFID scanner will work together with the MQTT broker and the Adafruit.io platform to connect and display the attendance data. RFID is Radio Frequency Identification which can then be analyzed from the platform. This eliminates the need for paper attendance which can not be easily manageable. The RFID reader and Tag is also a newly developed mechanism that can be used within this project making it an IoT-based project.
